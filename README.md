# Credit-Worthiness-Prediction
The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can determine the credit worthiness of a customer. 0 indicates a high risk, and 1 indicates a low risk.

The K nearest neighbor algorithm is used for performing classification.To classify the credit, the similarities from train data to test data are calculated and k nearest neighbors are obtained. From k nearest neighbors, the labels to identify the creditworthiness of a customer can be obtained.
